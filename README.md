## Development

### Initial Setup

- Install your NPM modules

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Start the Postgres Database in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in
  > the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is
  > running before proceeding.

- Copy .env.example to .env, and update the following:

  - DATABASE_URL to remove the \_test at the end, as that's used for the testing
    pipeline
  - DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: Go to discord.com/developers, create an application, and
    then under the OAuth2 tab in settings, use the client ID
  - DISCORD_SECRET: On the same page as above, use the client secret (you may
    need to reset yours)
  - SESSION_SECRET: Not required but does set a different string for encrypting

- While you're in the discord developer settings, you'll also want to set
  redirects to the following if you want to test Discord authentication

```
http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback
```

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Load database dump if you have one.

```sh
cat NAME_OF_BACKUP_FILE | docker exec -i NAME_OF_DOCKER_CONTAINER psql -U postgres flexspotff
```

(you may need to drop/create the db if that gives you a bunch of errors, you can
do this to solve it)

```sh
docker exec -i flexspotff-postgres-1 dropdb -U postgres flexspotff
docker exec -i flexspotff-postgres-1 createdb -U postgres flexspotff
```

- Run the first build:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

If you'd prefer not to use Docker, you can also use Fly's Wireguard VPN to
connect to a development database (or even your production database). You can
find the instructions to set up Wireguard
[here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#install-your-wireguard-app),
and the instructions for creating a development database
[here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/).

## Deployment

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that
gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running
tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in
the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create
a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for
selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start
the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database
is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go
through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just
make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one
another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`.
We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via
[`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your
editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and
auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run
`npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project.
It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the
[VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode))
to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can
run to format all files in the project.

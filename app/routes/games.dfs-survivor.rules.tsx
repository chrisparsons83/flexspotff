        <p>
          Each week, you will select a lineup consisting of 2 QBs, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, and 1 DST. 
          At the end of the week, your lineup's total points will be calculated and added to your overall score.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You have until the start of a player's game to add or remove them from your lineup.
          You cannot reuse any players you have already selected in previous weeks.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Scoring will follow the same system as the Discord leagues. 
          For more details, please refer to the <a href="/leagues/rules">league's scoring rules</a>.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The player with the most points at the end of week 17 will be declared the winner. 
          There are no penalties for missing a week or leaving a player slot empty.

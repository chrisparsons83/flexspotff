      <h2>Locks Challenge Rules</h2>

      <p>
        Each week, you get to pick the winner of as many games as you'd like to
        choose. At the end of the week, if none of the teams you selected lost,
        you get one point per team you selected that won.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if any of your teams lose in that week, you score zero points
        for that week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ties don't count as a loss, but you don't get any points for a win from
        them either.
      </p>

      <p>
        The player with the most points at the end of week 17 wins. There
        are no penalties for not picking any teams in a week besides foregoing
        the opportunity to earn points that week.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        3.2. Members from the previous season will be given a period of at least

      </p>

      <p>
        3.3. After priority placement of members of the previous season, new
        members are added based on their registration submission date and time.
      </p>

      <p>
        3.4. The commissioners reserve the right to limit the number of leagues
        that are run within a season. Reasons for this include, but are not
        limited to: balancing the number of leagues for even numbers for

      </p>

      <p>
        4.3. The IR position may be used for players that are ruled out due to

      <h3 id="6-draft">6. Draft</h3>

      <p>
        6.1. Draft Date/Time will be determined by the members of each
        individual league to accommodate all members as best as possible. It may
        not be possible to accommodate all members, but the goal is to
        accommodate the most members.
      </p>

      <p>
        6.2. Draft order is randomized at least one hour before the draft. The
        method of randomization may be determined by the members of the
        individual league, but it must be fully random, as deemed by the
        commissioners.
      </p>

      <p>
        6.3. It is important that members respond in a reasonable amount of time
        at the point when the leagues are being created and draft times are
        being selected. Members that don’t respond within 72 hours for selecting
        preferred draft times or aren’t signed up for their leagues 72 hours
        before the draft is scheduled to start may be replaced via the waitlist.
      </p>

      <p>6.4. The draft will be 15 rounds in a snake format.</p>

      <p>6.5. All drafts will be run using a 90-second pick timer.</p>

      <p>6.6. Draft picks cannot be traded.</p>

      <p>6.7. There are no requirements to fill every starting position.</p>

      <p>
        6.8. If a member cannot attend the draft and it is acceptable to them,
        they may appoint a designee that is not within the same league to draft
        for them, or they may autodraft.
      </p>

      <p>
        6.9. League drafts will start at the agreed upon time. It is the
        member’s responsibility to make sure they are available.
      </p>

      <h3 id="7-waivers">7. Waivers</h3>

      <p>
        7.1. Waivers will open up immediately upon the conclusion of the draft.
      </p>

      <p>
        7.2. FFDiscord Club leagues will operate under a FAAB system. Bids will
        be processed overnight Tuesday. Any remaining players after bids are
        processed will be free agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        7.3. All teams will have a $100 FAAB budget to spend over the entire
        season, which includes the regular season and the playoffs.
      </p>

      <p>7.4. The minimum bid for a waiver is $0.</p>

      <p>
        7.5. If there is a tie between multiple teams on the amount bid for a
        player, the tiebreaker is determined by the priority order listed on the
        website hosting the leagues.
      </p>

      <p>
        7.6. It is expected that all players in the NFL universe may be
        rostered. This rule may be dependent on the hosting site in question.
        FFDiscord Club commissioners do not have control over adding players
        into the system that are missing.
      </p>

      <p>
        7.7. There is no limit on the number of acquisitions that can be
        performed over the season.

        8.1. Trades will open up immediately upon the conclusion of the draft,
        and will remain open until the trade deadline, which is in week 13 of
        the NFL season.
      </p>

      <p>
        8.2. Trades will not have a review period (effective immediately when
        accepted) and will be conducted under the integrity system.
      </p>

      <p>
        8.3 If collusion is suspected (a trade where both teams are working
        together to improve only one team) any member can request a trade
        review. A lopsided trade will not be grounds for trade review.
      </p>

      <p>8.4. The trade review will be run by the commissioners of the Club.</p>

      <p>
        8.4a. If a commissioner is involved in the trade that is being reviewed,
        they will recuse themselves from the review.
      </p>

      <p>
        8.5. If members are deemed to have colluded, both members are
        immediately removed from the Club.
      </p>

      <p>8.6. FAAB budget may be traded.</p>

      <p>
        8.7. There is no limit on the number of trades that can be performed.

      <h3 id="9-regular-season">9. Regular Season</h3>

      <p>
        9.1. The regular season will last through Week 14 of the NFL regular
        season.
      </p>

      <p>
        9.2. The head-to-head matchup schedule will be auto-generated by
        Sleeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        9.3. There are no divisions within a league. All teams will be in a
        single group.
      </p>

      <p>
        9.4. Weekly head-to-head matchups will be determined by the points
        scored by a team’s starters.
      </p>

      <p>
        9.5. In addition to weekly head-to-head matchups, there will be an
        additional game played against the median score of the league for that
        week by all members. The median score is defined in a 12-member league
        as the mean of the 6th and 7th place scores for that week. These games
        counts towards the league standings. For most weeks, this means the top
        six fantasy point scoring members of the league in a given week will
        earn an additional win, and the bottom six fantasy point scoring members
        of the league will earn an additional loss.
      </p>

      <h3 id="10-valid-lineups">10. Valid Lineups</h3>

      <p>
        10.1. Lineups, both starting and bench players, lock individually at
        scheduled game time.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.2. Each team is expected to field a valid lineup (no bye week
        players, no players on IR). See rule 10.5 for situations where an empty
        lineup slot is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.3. In the event of a computer failure, the league member must contact
        a Commissioner via Discord to request a lineup substitution. The
        substitution must be made prior to each player locking. The lineup
        substitution request must not be an edited message so the timestamp can
        be verified. In the event of a request made before a lock, but the
        commissioner cannot address it before it locks, the commissioner will
        inform the member’s opponent of the situation, and retroactively set the
        lineup.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.4. Empty lineup slots are permitted for strategic purposes. Examples
        include, but not limited to: benching a Monday night player when they
        are ahead of their opponent who does not have any more active players,
        not playing a kicker because they don’t want to drop a player, playing a
        player on bye because they don’t want to drop a player. Players that are
        going to play an empty lineup spot for strategic purposes need to
        declare their intent to a Commissioner or in the main FFDiscord Club
        channel.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.5. Members that do not field a valid lineup must explain their
        reason, whether it be intentional or unintentional, before waivers clear
        the following week. Members that fail to do this will have their team
        considered abandoned, and eligible for mid-season replacement.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.5a. If a member explains their reason after their team becomes
        eligible for mid-season replacement but before the team has been
        reassigned to a new owner, the Commissioners may remove the team’s
        eligibility for mid-season replacement and leave the team with the
        original owner at their discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.5b. If a member does not field a valid lineup for a player declared
        out due to IR announced that morning because of COVID-19, this is an
        acceptable reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.6. Teams eligible for mid-season replacement will be filled in the
        following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Potential members that waitlisted for the FFDiscord Club but did not
          receive a team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Potential members that volunteer to take over the team based on a
          notification on the team’s eligibility to receive a new owner on the
          Discord server.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        10.6a. If a team eligible for mid-season replacement does not have an
        owner in time for upcoming games, the Commissioners will set the roster
        based on maximizing projected fantasy points listed on the website. No
        players will be added/dropped from the roster; this may cause a team to
        not field a valid lineup, particularly if a kicker or D/ST is on bye.
      </p>

      <p>
        10.7. Members that fill a team mid-season will be given priority
        registration for the following season.
      </p>

      <h3 id="11-the-cup">11. The Cup</h3>

      <p>
        11.1. The Cup is a single elimination tournament that takes place
        between all teams in all leagues.
      </p>

      <p>
        11.2. The weeks before the first NFL bye week will be used to set
        seeding for the single elimination bracket. Seeding is based on Points
        For a manager earns during those weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        11.3. Starting in the first NFL bye week, teams will face off against
        one another based on their placement in the overall Cup bracket. The
        fantasy points a manager’s team scores in their weekly matchup will also
        apply to their Cup match.
      </p>

      <p>
        11.4. The team winning the cup match will advance to the next round of
        the bracket. This will proceed until all but one team have been
        eliminated, who will be named the Cup Champion.
      </p>

      <p>
        11.5. The bracket will be sized so that matchups only happen during bye
        weeks. If there are more bye weeks than rounds, later rounds will become
        two-week matchups.
      </p>

      <h3 id="12-tiebreakers">12. Tiebreakers</h3>

      <p>
        12.1. There are no tiebreaker settings for regular season matches as
        fractional scoring does not frequently yield ties.
      </p>

      <p>
        12.2. Tiebreakers for playoff seeds are broken in the following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Highest Overall Record</li>
        <li>Most Points For</li>
        <li>Most Points Against</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        12.3. If a playoff match is tied, then the higher seed will advance.
      </p>

      <p>12.4. If a Cup match is tied, then the higher seed will advance.</p>

      <h3 id="13-playoffs">13. Playoffs</h3>

      <p>
        13.1. The playoffs will begin with NFL Week 15 and end at the conclusion
        of NFL Week 17.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.2. The six teams with the best regular season records within each
        individual league will be eligible for the playoffs. Ties are broken
        based on the tiebreaking system in rule 11.2.
      </p>

      <p>13.3. The top two seeds will receive a bye in the first round.</p>

      <p>13.4. Playoff matches will be one-week playoff games.</p>

      <h3 id="14-league-hierarchy">14. League Hierarchy</h3>

      <p>
        14.1. The FFDiscord Club is distributed into two “tiers”: Tier One, and
        Tier Two. Tier One consists of a single 12-member league, known as the
        Champions League. Tier Two consists of multiple 12-member leagues, and
        can vary in quantity of leagues from season to season.
      </p>

      <p>
        14.2. At the beginning of each season, all eligible members that are not
        within Tier One will be placed into one of the leagues within Tier Two.
        Placement in those leagues is done by random draw.
      </p>

      <p>14.3. Members only play against opponents within his or her league.</p>

      <p>
        14.4. There is only one champion per league (i.e. no ties or
        co-champions).
      </p>

      <h3 id="15-promotionrelegation">15. Promotion/Relegation</h3>

      <p>
        15.1. At the end of each season, a certain number of top and bottom
        members in each league will be promoted/relegated to the next
        higher/lower tier. These promotion and relegation zones are set at the
        beginning of the season, with sizes determined by roster size of the
        given and proximal tier and association pyramid structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        15.1a. With four leagues within Tier Two, the Champions League bottom
        six finishers in the final standings will be relegated down to Tier Two.
        The winner of each Tier Two league will be promoted to the Champions
        League the following season. In addition, the player across Tier Two
        with the highest regular-season Points For that does not win their
        respective League will also be promoted to the Champions League the
        following season. Lastly, the player that wins The Cup will also receive
        a promotion to the Champions League.
      </p>

      <p>
        15.2. In the case of any vacancy in the Champions League before the
        start of the season, the first open spot will be given to the member
        that had the highest Points-For across the Tier Two leagues at the end
        of the regular season that did not already receive a promotion to the
        Champions League, as long as they meet all other requirements for
        membership. This will continue until there is a full roster of 12 for
        the Champions League.
      </p>

      <p>
        15.3. Under no circumstance will a member who finishes in the relegation
        zone of a tier return to that tier the following season, with the
        exception of winning The Cup, and during seasons which involve
        significant member realignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        15.4. The promotion and relegation criteria for a given season will be
        determined and published before the start of the season.
      </p>

      <p>
        15.5. If the NFL does not complete 17 regular-season weeks, then there
        will be no promotion/relegation for that season, and the following
        season will contain the same members in each tier. Players within a tier
        will be reshuffled if there are multiple leagues within the tier.
      </p>

      <h3 id="16-rookie-members">16. Rookie Members</h3>

      <p>16.1. New members to the FFDiscord Club will begin in Tier Two.</p>

      <h3 id="17-re-entry">17. Re-Entry</h3>

      <p>
        17.1. If a member leaves the league for a season, when applying for
        re-entry, their past seasons may optionally count towards priority
        placement at the discretion of the commissioners.
      </p>

      <p>
        17.2. Members removed from the FFDiscord Club for disciplinary reasons
        must be approved by a majority of the commissioners in order to be
        readmitted to the league.
      </p>

      <h3 id="18-league-growth-and-expansion">
        18. League Growth and Expansion
      </h3>

      <p>
        18.1. In future seasons, as the number of members increases, leagues
        will be added in Tier Two to accommodate the growth.
      </p>

      <h3 id="19-player-conduct">19. Player Conduct</h3>

      <p>

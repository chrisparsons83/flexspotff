        Discord's Profane, Delusional Football Fans are Shaking up the Fantasy
        Landscape
      </h2>
      <p>
        In a dingy corner of the internet is a message board, soaked in
        self-promotion, armchair analysis, and Fat Shack burger grease, where
        posters with handles such as KingPin Officer Brando and CarneAsadaNachos
        campaign for their favorite fantasy players, spamming photoshopped hype
        images and putting up screenshots from their online FanDuel accounts of
        their 13-way parlays— showing off their massive losses like badges of
        honor. Some of them think they’ve found the key to easy wins in yahoo
        public leagues. Actual fantasy analysts doubt they’re right, but they’re
        getting nervous about what happens there.

        History hasn’t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The
        latest Juju Smith-Schuster sell-off, driven by a new wave of Mason
        Rudolph fear, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even
        industry experts have trouble dismissing a 1,000 user Discord forum,
        whose hot takes and blind homerism have shown an uncanny ability to sink
        sleepers, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleeper players such as
        Alex Barnes and Gary Jennings Jr. went straight to the practice squad
        shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have even added a
        little froth to Antonio Brown’s 30 million dollar meltdown.

        The do-it-yourself GMs of discord are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare
        in the drafts, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the hive
        mind to move draft prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered
        about where the lemmings who made the fantasy football subreddit so shit
        went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual
        fantasy managers seem to be finding their way back to stats, for better
        or worse. They’re flexing bad takes in ways that can easily call to mind
        the absurdity of the Mathew Berry Fantasy Show.

        “There is no denying the fact that in the month of March 2020, the mocks
        are back,” says @BustyEpstein, chief equity and derivatives strategist
        at #mock-drafts. He thinks Damien Williams’ ADP can jump an extra 10%
        because of all his personal mock drafts. “These rankings are not going
        to end until the public falls in love with players, and that process may
        just be beginning.” Of course, timing the moment when irrational
        exuberance gives way to a massive bust isn’t so easy. Chatrooms where
        players are hyped were an integral component of the “Josh Garden!” boom
        and the following bust. They remain a setting for bare-fisted digital
        brawls among all manner of pizza bet hustlers and shameless
        self-promoters, many of whom could move players on a dime—sometimes just
        enough so they could get out and leave others holding the corpse of Nick
        Foles.

        Seven years after the herculean rise of Flash, one thing that’s changed
        is the nomenclature. It’s frequently both juvenile and objectionable.
        For discord’s band of self-styled “degens”—a term of endearment,
        relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding
        extremely addicted sports fans—the chief prize is “pins” (pinned
        messages, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a
        “shit-poster”). Figuratively speaking, pins are the tangible reward that
        follow from a successfully shitty joke or awful take. Bears players are
        usually referred to in homophobic terms.

        What this moment shares with 2013 is a rising belief that you can “sell
        high” on any player who just strung together any number of competent NFL
        performances, regardless of context or underlying variables. But while
        most Discord FF Club members at the end of the trade deadline were
        willing to wait around for a “greater fool” to show up and buy their
        fool’s gold, a certain self-professed trade expert in Monarch believes
        he can conjure up those assets through his own trading sleight of hand.

        Members of this still unnamed fantasy football discord server believe
        they’ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay
        of yahoo best ball drafts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether
        players will boom or bust without drafting the player in a real league.
        It goes like this: members make predictions that rely on low probability
        outcomes, but don’t want to be held accountable for their baseless and
        sensationalist takes in a server that was originally intended to be a
        hub for independent statistical analysis. The fantasy platforms that
        offer best ball drafts allow them to make all the bold predictions they
        want, and if they fail, they can tell everyone they only joined 3 best
        ball leagues instead of the actual 38. Server admins, like rational
        human beings, don’t want to keep track of all these asinine hot takes,
        so they disabled the !predictions command. When taking a bet, they make
        the competing ff addicts deal with it themselves in #bets. If someone
        offers a pizza bet, for instance, on the outcome of a matchup, the loser
        has to pay up $14.84. If it’s a pfp bet, the loser may have to showcase
        some of the winner’s personal ‘fursona’ hentai—but that’s offset by the
        gains for their “brand.”
      </p>

        When ADPs keep rising, managing the hedge entails controlling the
        narrative of the hype train. That’s where the discord perceives a
        weakness. A favorite tactic on the discord is to swamp the entire league
        with trade requests at all hours in an attempt to force other managers
        to completely lose track of their players’ values. Up and up everything
        goes—supposedly. As the ADP rises, so does the value of the trade bait,
        often by far more.
      </p>

        In this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one’s
        own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It’s
        all relatively cheap in terms of actual draft capital used in trade
        negotiations. For the price of one share of Robert Woods—drafted about
        4.04 on Aug. 23rd—a season-long campaign can be waged in long-shot trade
        offers for other teams’ studs. That matters nowadays, when the rise of
        strategies such as Zero RB and “QBs score the most points so you have to
        pick a good one” have convinced fantasy managers that they no longer
        need to spend their chore money on the Fantasy Footballers Ultimate
        Draft Kit TM in order to ruin their season. Many fantasy teams now trade
        for three or four defenses a season.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear, there’s no magic money machine in trading your entire team
        before week one. The guy claiming his brand new team is an “orphan” he
        took over is hardly the only player buying and selling his picks. If the
        rest of the fantasy community sees a reason to sell a player, it won’t
        matter that your “brand” is pushing it. While hype trains can produce
        eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.

        But suddenly, once reserved server commissioners are putting their mark
        on the shade throwing market. How influential have they become?
        Typically hot takes and shit posts are in higher demand than sick burns
        because posters are more interested in talking about their own rosters.
        That’s often not the case now—with some server members, demand for the
        public smack down is higher. When asked about the role of server
        moderators in the public shaming of other users, “stfu vert” was all
        that was offered by user KingPin Officer Brando, a New Jersey pistol
        jockey whose hatred of walls is surpassed only by his fear of breast
        milk.{' '}

        Peltron3030, a Minnesota natural gas expert and stay-at-home mom, was
        initially skeptical that the chimpanzees in TB12 jerseys behind the
        online message board could analyze literally anything. He changed his
        mind. “At least from the regulars”—the real OG members—“they’ll show you
        in color coded google sheets, air yards are substantial, and it’s
        changing things,” he says. Smaller brains in the server are even more
        sensitive to sudden bursts of posting in #analytics.

        Madmike, a server moderator and professional cougar poacher, says it’s
        hard to say whether today’s discord or the subreddit in late 2013 has
        bigger sway. “When I was sitting in a stickied WDIS thread on /r/ff,
        calling people cucks and speculating on players’ IQ, you would see
        certain players be mentioned in comment threads, and the process would
        then be one person saying to another, ‘Hey, this guy looks
        interesting,’ ” he says. “Now, you see something posted in discord, and
        you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.” Instead, users
        jump in frothing at the mouth to spew their hot takes. “it makes perfect
        sense, you just have to read what im saying and then youll understand
        and be that much smarter,” Madmike says. In other words, don’t just wag
        a finger at online message boards filled with memes and other
        nonsense—look at the supposedly sophisticated fantasy analysts that are
        running them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members are aware that questionable thinking underpins their analysis,
        to the point of self-deprecation. After user Wolffftavius II wondered
        whether their activities might constitute a real XFL podcast, a user
        named IceMaine replied, “go wrap a tortilla around a poptart and fellate
        yourself.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The forum’s zest for hype trains is a key force behind a broad ADP
        market trend. By one measure, the value of hyped player Dante Pettis
        rose 770% over the first nine months of 2019. Much of this expansion was
        concentrated among a handful of individuals across dozens of dynasty
        leagues each. Dudekids, owner and operator of imaginary Chapter 7
        Bankruptcy candidate “DK Locks Co. Inc.” says “The size of the increase
        in brand name recognition and profitability of DudeKash is definitely
        moving the needle,” not at all answering the question we asked him.

        The average number of football or fantasy related posts has shrunk by
        nearly 87% this off-season, roughly half what it was in the 2017
        off-season, says discord user Rob, a snobbiness connoisseur and
        up-and-coming performing artist under the moniker Big Friday. Looking at
        the combination of #off-topic, #food, and #music, he concludes, “Really,
        it’s all a bunch of sodding rubbish. Bloody gits, the lot of em.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As the dick measuring discord user’s imprint on the fantasy industry
        becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their
        policing of their forum. One user, who’d been a member for three years
        without posting, laid out the bull case for cooking bacon in the oven,
        and promised another “culinary life-hack” the following morning. Post
        volumes in the #food channel jumped to 71 times the previous one-month
        average, with bacon related pictures raising 1860%. This user was
        promptly banned from the discord upon providing the next tip, a recipe
        for homemade sourdough, with a moderator claiming that the poster “tried
        to use the platform for personal grain.” Members were warned that any
        interactions with the user on discord or discussion of the user’s latest
        recommendation would also get them kicked out. “I’m fucking fuming”
        wrote user Bootzay, complaining about the influx of cicadas in the
        discord voice channel. “Can we just go back to talking about Tyler
        Lockett?”

        BOTTOM LINE – Grandstanding on a discord message board is pushing up
        ADPs on fantasy players and reshaping the dynasty trade market.
        Anonymous online fantasy personalities are here—for better or for worse.

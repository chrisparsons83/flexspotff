      <h3>1. Object</h3>
      <p>
        1.1. The object of Omni is to draft teams or individuals that perform
        well, either via playoffs or regular season, depending on sport, and
        score the most points over the 12-month season.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Rosters</h3>
      <p>
        2.1. In 2025, rosters will consist of 24 spots. These spots include the
        19 sports listed below, along with 5 flex spots that can be filled with
        an entry from any sport.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aussie Rules Football</li>
        <li>Formula 1</li>
        <li>Golf - Men's</li>
        <li>Golf - Women's</li>
        <li>League of Legends World Championship</li>
        <li>Major League Baseball</li>

        <li>NCAA Basketball - D1 Women's</li>
        <li>NCAA Football - FBS</li>
        <li>NCAA Lacrosse - D1 Men's</li>

        <li>National Hockey League</li>
        <li>PDC World Darts Championship</li>
        <li>Tennis - Men's</li>
        <li>Tennis - Women's</li>
        <li>UEFA Champions League</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        2.2. All teams must draft at least one team/individual from each sport.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Scoring</h3>
      <p>
        3.1. While each sport has different ways of determining their top 8, the
        top 8 are awarded points as followed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st: 80 points</li>
        <li>2nd: 50 points</li>
        <li>3rd-4th: 30 points</li>
        <li>5th-8th: 20 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        3.2. In Golf and Tennis, which are scored by majors as opposed to a
        single tournament or a season-ending ranking, at each major, players
        will earn qualifying points under the following system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st: 8 points</li>
        <li>2nd: 5 points</li>
        <li>3rd-4th: 3 points</li>
        <li>5th-8th: 2 points</li>
        <li>9th-16th: 1 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These qualifying points are not counted towards a team's total score,
        but they are used to determine placement. Once the last major of a
        season is completed, the combined points from all majors will be added
        together and that ranking will be used to award the points detailed in
        3.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.3. If a team not drafted by anyone finishes in a point-scoring
        position, those points are not awarded. Someone drafting the 9th place
        team in that situation still earns zero points.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4. In sports where there is not a defined bracket for ranking and ties
        can happen, those ties between positions will have the points awarded
        equally, rounded to the nearest point. For instance, if there is a tie
        between second and third, both players will earn 40 points (50+30
        divided equally). If 8th, 9th, and 10th are tied, each of those players
        will earn 7 points (20+0+0 divided equally, rounded to the nearest
        point). This applies to both points awarded and golf and tennis
        qualifying points.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4. The top eight in this season's sports are defined in the following
        ways:

        available pool of players when they do make their pick, but cannot pick
        players that have since been drafted after their clock expired.
